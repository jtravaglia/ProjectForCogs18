This file is meant to be encrypted, it is written in English and should become Pig Latin when encrypted. Pig Latin is a fun gibberish like language often used by kids. It is easy to understand once you learn the basic rules, if a word starts with a consonant you move the consonant or consonant cluster at the beginning of the word to the end. For words starting with a vowel you add ay to the end of the word. Punctuation is not altered and remains in the same spot as it started!
